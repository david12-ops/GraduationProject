# GraduationProject
User-friendly web application designed to select a
supplier with a suitable package according to the parameters specified by the user. The
application allows management over the supplier and package database by the web
application administrator. It will allow the user to manage over his account (change
email, password, create account), and his order history stored by the user. The user will
be able to log in, register and log out.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
